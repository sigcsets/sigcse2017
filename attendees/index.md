This year, we are at the [Washington State Convention Center (WSCC)](http://www.wscc.com/), and the main conference hotel is the [Sheraton Seattle Hotel](http://www.sheratonseattle.com/) in Seattle, Washington.

This page will contain everything you need for registration, reserving a room, obtaining visas, and finding a roommate. For now, we want to make sure that rate information is available early to attendees.

## Registering for SIGCSE {{site.data.sigcse.year}}

<!--
# NOTES FROM NOV 23 2015 - FIXME
Early registration rates --  Apply through February 2.
Late registration rates -- Apply from February 3, through February 23.
Registration closed -- From February 24 through March 1, while we prepare registration packets
Onsite registration -- Available beginning Wednesday, March 2, at 3:00 PM, and as shown above

<div class="row">
{% callout info %}
Onsite registration will be open <b>Wednesday</b> from 3:00PM to 9:30PM, <b>Thursday</b> from 7:30AM to 5:30PM, <b>Friday</b> from 8:00AM to 5:00PM, and <b>Saturday</b> from 8:30AM to 11:45AM and 2:00PM to 3:00PM.

SIGCSE {{site.data.sigcse.year}} takes place between {{site.data.sigcse.date.month}} {{site.data.sigcse.date.start}} and {{site.data.sigcse.date.month}} {{site.data.sigcse.date.end}} of {{site.data.sigcse.year}}.

As always, we encourage attendees to register early. This helps us with our planning, and in return, you get lower registration rates!

{% if site.data.main.isregistrationopen %}
<div class="text-center">
<hr>
<h3><a href="{{site.data.main.registrationurl}}">Register now!</a></h3>
<hr>
</div>
{% else %}
<div class="text-center">
  <hr>
  Registration will open soon!
  <hr>
</div>
{% endif %}

<p>Also, if you are not currently a SIGCSE member, you should <b>consider joining at the same time that you register</b> for the conference. Professionals can <b>save between $30 and $55</b>, while both professionals and students <b>save time</b> by not having to fill out a separate membership form.  The <a href="http://sigcse.org/membership/benefits">benefits of SIGCSE membership</a>  are too numerous to list here, but they include the quarterly publications <i>ACM Inroads</i> and the <i>SIGCSE Bulletin</i>, free access to SIGCSE publication archives, access to the SIGCSE-ANNOUNCE and SIGCSE-MEMBERS mailing lists, and the opportunity to network within a community of computing professionals.</p>

Professionals should choose one of the "Non-member joining SIGCSE" registration categories, which are <b>less expensive</b> than the Non-member category. Students simply choose the "Student Non-member" registration category, and then don't opt-out of the included membership (that's right -- it couldn't be much easier). Alternatively, you could <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/membership">join SIGCSE</a>, wait for your membership number, and then register for the conference using the "Member" category.

But wait! There's more! <b>Student volunteers</b> get reimbursed for their conference registration, so they actually <b>get free SIGCSE membership</b> when they join at the same time that they register for the conference. Important: to get this benefit, students must register as volunteers through a system separate from conference registration.

{% comment %}
Also, it is <b>less expensive to join ACM SIGCSE and register for the conference as a regular member than to register as a regular non-member</b>. Joining SIGCSE is {{site.data.main.sigcsemembershipcost}} for professionals and {{site.data.main.sigcsestudentmembershipcost}} for students, and rates for regular member attendees are at least $75 less than regular nonmember attendees at all times. Furthermore, by joining you gain access to an incredible global network of dedicated professionals and educators who are part of the SIGCSE community, so it is a double benefit to join the world’s premier professional computer science education organization!

<p>If you <a href="{{site.data.main.sigcsemembershipurl}}">join SIGCSE</a> ({{site.data.main.sigcsemembershipcost}}/year), you save at least {{site.data.main.sigseregistrationsavings}} on your registration, and gain access to an incredible global network of dedicated professionals and educators who are part of the SIGCSE community.</p>

### YET MORE HOTELS

In no particular order, these additional hotels are generally within easy transportation distance (walking, bus) of the hotel. We recommend you use Google Maps to figure out what it looks like "on the ground" before you blindly reserve space into one of these.

{% for hotel in site.data.additionalhotels %}
<li> <b>{{hotel.name}}</b> <br>
  <ul>

## Find a Roommate!

You can also use the [SIGCSE roommate database](http://sigcse.rit.edu/roommates/) to find someone to room with. This is the preferred database of SIGCSE members around the world for finding roommates at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Honest.
