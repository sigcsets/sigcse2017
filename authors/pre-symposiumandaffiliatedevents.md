## Interested in organizing a special event at {{site.data.main.upper}}?  

The conference provides an opportunity for a limited number of pre-symposium events that will take place on {{site.data.cfp.presymposiumdates}}.  In the past, these events have included activities like workshops conducted by industry partners, computing education community roundtables, or mentoring sessions for new faculty.  However, there are no specific criteria for the topics and/or format of these events. Depending on space availability, we may also be able to host evening events during the symposium.

Pre-symposium events typically are scheduled as half or full day sessions, and the hosting organization will be charged a fee by the symposium to cover the costs of the event including, but not limited to, incurred audio/visual charges, room set-up fees, and catering orders.  Costs for each event will be determined based on your specific needs.

Please note:  Pre-symposium event proposals are not peer-reviewed and are not made part of the conference proceedings.  If you are looking for information about conference workshops, please see the CFP for more details.
