    - "Alex Edgcomb, Ph.D, Sr. Software Engineer/Research Specialist, zyBooks/University of California, Riverside"
  content: "CS courses often include the additional need to learn a complex set of support tools involving LMS's, discussion boards, e-book logins, homework systems, program submission systems, clickers, web links, online announcements, OS'es, IDEs, and other items, often involving poorly-designed UI's and workflows, making today's CS classes unnecessarily hard, and stressful. In this session, we will introduce: (1) zyBooks: Highly-interactive web-native CS learning material for nearly any lower-division CS course, featuring animations of challenging concepts, learning questions for engaged learning, and concise text for lucidity. Instructors can award points for completion, rearrange sections to match their syllabus, and add notes to content; (2) Our challenge activities (\"homework\"), fully integrated within each zyBook section, many algorithmically-generated, all auto-graded; (3) Our zyLabs system, \"The easiest program submission and grading system on the planet\", and seamlessly integratable with a zyBook, or usable standalone; and (4) Our user-experience focus that guides how the content and platform are designed, how we provide support and respond to feedback, and more. We will show how instructors use those items to eliminate non-essential complexity and help focus students on learning concepts and programming, and summarize research showing improved learning outcomes as well as happier, less-stressed students."

The session will also articulate the benefits of obtaining program accreditation in the computing field. <br> ABET continues to evolve its computing accreditation criteria as the computing disciplines evolve. During 2016, ABET provided initial approval to new computing accreditation criteria, that—in final form--will be rolled out over the next several years for both new accreditations and re-accreditations. These criteria, which are currently undergoing public review, include revisions to the general computing criteria and to program criteria for computer science, information technology and information systems. This session will discuss the new criteria and provide an opportunity for audience feedback to be considered in the final revision that is currently in progress. <br> ABET is also developing new program criteria to accredit cybersecurity programs. This session will provide a progress report on that effort and will provide an opportunity for audience feedback on the proposed cybersecurity program criteria."
